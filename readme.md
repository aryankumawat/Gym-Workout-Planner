## Workout Plan Details

### Age-Based Adjustments

The program automatically adjusts workout intensity based on age:
- **Ages 60-65**: 0-5% reduction
- **Ages 65-75**: 5-25% reduction
- **Ages 75-80**: 25-40% reduction
- **Ages 80+**: 40-80% reduction (capped at 80%)

### Workout Structure

Each workout plan includes:
- Exercise name
- Number of repetitions or duration
- Number of sets
- Adjusted intensity based on age

### Training Schedule

The program intelligently alternates between:
- Your goal-specific workout
- Age and gender-appropriate general workout

This ensures balanced training that targets your specific goals while maintaining overall fitness.
